| 152 | Maximum Product Subarray | Array / Greedy / Kadane's Algorithm | O(n) | Run Kadane-style product scan from both ends to handle negative numbers and zeros. Check for max at every iteration and if product is 0, make it 1. |
| 287 | Find The Duplicate Number | Two Pointers / Cycle Detection | O(n) | We cant create new Data Structures, only new variables can be created. Array cannot be modified. Used the hare and tortoise approach to detect the cycle first and then find the duplicate element. |
